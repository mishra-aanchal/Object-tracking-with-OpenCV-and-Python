# project is for those who want to start working with OpenCV for Computer Vision projects.
We'll learn Object Tracking with OpenCV and Python. At the end of this project, you will know how Optical and Dense Optical Flow works,
how to use the MeanShift and the CamShift and you will be able to do a Single Object Tracking and a Multi-Object Tracking.
